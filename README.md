Applications of Deep Learning Project Fall 2022

Used two models VGG16 and Transformers to achieve the task
Used Streamlit st.camera_input for capturing the image using web camera and st.file_uploader to upload existing photo.

1) Transformer Model

2) Image Captioning using VGG16
      The method of captioning images can be logically divided into two modules: an image-based model, which extracts the details and nuances from the image, and               language-based model, which converts the details and objects from the image-based model into natural phrases.

   ** The captions generated by transformer pipeline were better than the ones generated by VGG16. **
